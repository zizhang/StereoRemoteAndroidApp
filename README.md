Project Details

As part of a project course, we were asked to write an Android App that would act as a stereo remote. The app sends commands to a middleman software, which relays the commands to the Altera DE2 board. The DE2 board was programmed to play 10 second .wav files.

Some of the features implemented include:
- Playing, pausing and nexting songs
- creating playlists
- Twitter integration (Tweet currently playing song)
- soundboard with preloaded drum beats allowed for creating your own beats over currently playing song
- Voice commands
